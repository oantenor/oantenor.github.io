In the introduction of the book “The Eye of The Master,” the technical report “Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence” by Hubert L. Dreyfus is mentioned as one of the early examples of critical studies in the field of AI. In summary, this work analyzes, with some level of skepticism, the failed attempts of the time to reproduce cognitive processes in computers and their causes. The provocative comparison between alchemists and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence arises from the fact that, motivated by early successes, both are prone to dedicating time and effort to research that does not yield consistent empirical results leading to their ultimate goal: transmuting metals into gold and achieving General Artificial Intelligence (AGI). In the author’s words:

“The long reign of alchemy has shown that any research which has had an early success can always be justified and continued by those who prefer adventure over patience.”

Since the publication of this work in 1965, artificial neural networks and the perceptron have been established as the dominant paradigm in applications and research in artificial intelligence. They have been particularly driven by practices of digital colonialism, surveillance policies, and processes of invisibilization of work, especially for minorities and marginalized groups. In such context, the alchemists of our times would be the entrepreneurs, business people, and venture capitalists of Silicon Valley who invest their money in business models that bring them closer to their naive dream of complete automation and AGI, which only leads us to this extratificated society, defined by social and work hierarchies, based in the very own intelligence metrics that gave rise to the neural network models in the first place.

Regarding Dreyfus’s article, the author points out that, in general, the field of AI exhibits a recurring pattern: sudden and accelerated success, followed by difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Considering all the advances, especially those led by OpenAI last year, and the accompanying discussions, I believe it can be asserted that we are in a moment of collective cultural catharsis, characteristic of the first phase of sudden success, where the long-term impacts of this technology are overestimated, while there is little clarity about the unfolding of political and economic processes related to these advances in the short term.

Therefore, if the pattern pointed out by Dreyfus repeats, it is possible to assume that this moment of optimism by the economic and political forces guiding the development of AI models will be followed by a new phase marked by unexpected obstacles.

My question in this case is: given the social nature of the structure that enables the development of these models, how can organized social movements present alternatives and obstacles to large tech groups and companies to reconfigure some of the relationships characterizing these algorithms of domination and control? What forms can these obstacles take? The roads paved by the Hollywood Writers Strikes that happened last year are the way to go?
